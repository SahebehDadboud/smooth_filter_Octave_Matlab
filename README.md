# smooth_filter_Octave_Matlab
following project will be presented to illustrate the technique for smooth filter by using adjacent and also a low pass filter. While ideal low pass, high pass can be derived analytically. the method I used was Fast Fouries Transform ( FFT method).Matlab or Octave
In smooth function as we will see after some time is damped.
